A *Bézier Patch* #b(u,v) is a parametric surface based on Bézier Curves, specifically combining many curves in 2 directions to describe a surface.

Just like a *Bézier Curve*, the Bézier Patch is defined by a set of control points #p_{i,j} with degrees #n and #m .
The intuition behind a Bézier Patch is first constructing Bézier Curves along the rows of the control points and then along the columns (or vice versa), resulting in a smooth surface.

To calculate a point on the patch it is represented as a *Tensor Product Surface*, this skips the sampling of Bézier Curves in both directions after each other and combines the computation:
@ b(u,v) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{m} B_{i,n}(u) \, B_{j,m}(v) \, p_{i,j} @
With #u,v #\in #[0,1] and #B_{i,n}(t) being the *Berstein polynomials* again. For more information refer to the info mode of the Bézier Curve.

The Bézier Patch is widely used in computer graphics and CAD applications for modeling smooth and flexible surfaces.
They can be used to represent many objects, such as the Utah Teapot, which consists of 32 bycubic Bézier Patches. Load a Utah Teapot under *File > Examples*.

*Properties of Bézier Patches:*
- The surface always lies within the convex hull of its control points.
- The patch interpolates the corner control points.
- The degree of the patch in the #u and #v directions is determined by the number of control points in each direction.
