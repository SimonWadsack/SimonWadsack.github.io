A *Linear Curve* is the simplest mathematical curve and just connects up the control points in a straight line.

It does not provide any smoothing or curvature between the points. 
Linear curves are useful for visualizing the basic structure of a set of points, for example, for the control polygon of a BÃ©zier Curve or a B-Spline.
