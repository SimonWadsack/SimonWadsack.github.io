A *Uniform Rational B-Spline Surface* (URBS Surface) is a parametric surface that extends the Uniform B-Spline Surface (UBS Surface) by assigning a weight #w_{i,j} to each control point #p_{i,j}. 
This allows for even greater flexibility and the ability to represent exact shapes like circles and ellipsoids, which are not possible with standard B-Spline surfaces.

Just like the BÃ©zier Patch and UBS Surface, the URBS Surface is defined by a grid of control points and uses the tensor product of basis functions in two directions. The difference is that each control point's influence is scaled by its weight.

The formula for a URBS Surface of degree #k in both directions is: 
@ c(u,v) = \frac{ \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{m} N_{i,k}(u) \, N_{j,k}(v) \, w_{i,j} \, p_{i,j} }{ \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{m} N_{i,k}(u) \, N_{j,k}(v) \, w_{i,j} } @
where #N_{i,k}(t) are the *B-Spline basis functions* of degree #k, and #u,v are the parameters in the interval defined by the knot vector in both directions. For more information refer to the info mode of the URBS Curve.

The Uniform Rational B-Spline Surface is widely used in computer graphics and CAD applications for modeling smooth and flexible surfaces.
